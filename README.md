# Flood Impact Analysis in Somalia

This repository contains a geospatial analysis of the flood impacts in Somalia, using GIS tools to assess damage to buildings, roads, agricultural land, and settlements.

## Project Overview

The analysis uses spatial data to quantify the impact of flooding in BeletWeyne, including:
- Clipping buildings, roads, and land cover layers to the flood extent
- Calculating key statistics, such as the number of affected buildings, total road length, and flooded agricultural areas
- Categorizing agricultural land and assessing settlements within a 500-meter buffer of the flood zone

This project provides crucial insights for emergency planning, resource allocation, and understanding flood vulnerability.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the analysis:

**Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3bdillahiomar/Flood-Analysis-Somalia.git
   ```
## Data

Multiple data sources were utilized to perform the flood impact analysis, including:
- **Flood Extent Data**: Polygon representation of the flooded areas.
- **Building Footprints**: A dataset of buildings in BeletWeyne for impact assessment.
- **Roads Data**: A dataset of road networks used for calculating affected infrastructure.
- **Land Cover Data**: Used to assess the agricultural land impacted by the floods.
- **Settlements Data**: A dataset of settlements used to identify those within a 500-meter buffer of the flood zone.

Flood data is not stored online and can be shared upon request, either through the contact persona above or through the authors.
